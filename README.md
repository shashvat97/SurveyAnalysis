Analyzed Survey Responses to remote study arrangement on Google Looker Studio

*Project Overview* <br>
When studying online, feedback enables the student to evaluate their development and identify possible areas for growth. It stimulates reflective thinking, better retention of information, and productive dialogue with teachers or other online students. The Survey can help institutions to act and consider improvements to stabilize the current learning environment. The goal of this research study is to determine what students enjoy about the current arrangements and what they would like to alter in the current distance learning environment.
